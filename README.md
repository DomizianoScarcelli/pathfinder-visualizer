# Pathfinder Visualizer

The web app allows the user to visualize the execution of a pathfinding algorithm.

# Execution
The user has to:
- Insert a start point
- Insert a ending point
- Draw walls if wanted
- Run the pathfinding algorithm

The app will show the pathfinding execution and, when it ends, the minimum path between the start and ending point, without passing through walls.
